    data : array or list of array
        Image data. Can be N >= 2 dimensional. If the last dimension has length
        3 or 4 can be interpreted as RGB or RGBA if rgb is `True`. If a
        list and arrays are decreasing in shape then the data is treated as
        a multiscale image. Please note multiscale rendering is only
        supported in 2D. In 3D, only the lowest resolution scale is
        displayed.
    channel_axis : int, optional

        will be applied to the Nth channel in the data. If a single value
        is provided, it will be broadcast to all Layers.
        All parameters except data, rgb, and multiscale can be provided as
        list of values. If a list is provided, it must be the same length as

        The first (N, N) entries correspond to a linear transform and
        the final column is a length N translation vector and a 1 or a
        napari `Affine` transform object. Applied as an extra transform on
        top of the provided scale, rotate, and shear values.
    attenuation : float or list of float
        Attenuation rate for attenuated maximum intensity projection.

        alpha values of the layer visual get mixed. Allowed values are
        {'translucent', 'translucent_no_depth', 'additive', 'minimum', 'opaque'}.
    cache : bool or list of bool
        Whether slices of out-of-core datasets should be cached upon
        retrieval. Currently, this only applies to dask arrays.
    colormap : str, napari.utils.Colormap, tuple, dict, list or list of these types
        Colormaps to use for luminance images. If a string, it can be the name
        of a supported colormap from vispy or matplotlib or the name of

        The first (N, N) entries correspond to a linear transform and

        {'opaque', 'translucent', and 'additive'}.
    cache : bool
        Whether slices of out-of-core datasets should be cached upon retrieval.
        Currently, this only applies to dask arrays.
    colormap : str, napari.utils.Colormap, tuple, dict
        Colormap to use for luminance images. If a string must be the name
        of a supported colormap from vispy or matplotlib. If a tuple the
        first value must be a string to assign as a name to a colormap and

        Colormap.
    contrast_limits : list (2,)

        Each dict defines a clipping plane in 3D in data coordinates.
        Valid dictionary keys are {'position', 'normal', and 'enabled'}.

    rotate : float, 3-tuple of float, or n-D array.
        If a float convert into a 2D rotation matrix using that value as an
        angle. If 3-tuple convert into a 3D rotation matrix, using a yaw,
        pitch, roll convention. Otherwise assume an nD rotation. Angles are

        texture. Coordinates outside this range will wrap, but this behavior
        should be considered an implementation detail: there are no plans to
        change it, but it's a feature of the underlying vispy visual.
    texture: (I, J) or (I, J, C) array
        A 2D texture to be mapped onto the mesh using `texcoords`.
        C may be 3 (RGB) or 4 (RGBA) channels for a color texture.
